Hello, this is my first VSC theme ever, so i don't really know how to start this documentation.
I want to create a cute theme based on hello kitty colours for you to create cute things in code ! (and because the new hello kitty island adventures game are now out :) 

In this file you will find how to install your new theme and all the changes i will made in the future.

Enjoy it and feel free to install !!! <3
